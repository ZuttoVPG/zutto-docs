# ZuttoPets Design
## Overview
Every player begins the game with a plot of land upon which is built a small house. The player and their pets will reside on this plot of land.

The game revolves around upgrading this plot of land to increase the number and types of pets they can have. The pets can, in turn, help the player create a bigger & better base.

The goal of the game is to complete collections by ascending through tiers of crafting/pets/base structures. Completing collections will reward the players with things like rare pets, rare pet skins, large quantities of crafting materials, or the ability to craft more advanced things.

To drive player engagement, the player will need to log in regularly to gather the resources (primary crafting materials) that have accumulated.  

The game is intended to be a cross between an incremental game like Cookie Clicker and a classic pet game.

## Pets
Despite drawing heavily on incremental games, pets are _not_ merely workers. Each pet will have a name, equipment, skills, and potentially a skin.

The number of pets actively kept on the player's base should be kept fairly small so that each pet has impact and feels important.

### Pet Types
- align to the gathering stuff??
- advanced types??

### Equipment

### Skills
Pet skills will affect resource gathering or crafting and will be randomly assigned from a pool of possible skills when the pet is created.

Skill bonuses should apply only when the pet is an active member of the base.

#### Gathering Skills
If a pet with a gathering skill is destroyed or stored in cryo, its skill bonus should only apply to the uncollected resources from periods that it was active (ie you stored 3 days but swapped the pet out 1.5 days in; 1.5days should have its bonus applied).

| Skill             | Effect              | %       | Rarity   |
| ----------------- |:-------------------:| -------:| --------:|
| Miner             | Harvest X% more ore | 5 - 10  | Common   |
| Farmer            | Harvest X% more from fields | 5 - 10  | Common |
| Eager             | Harvest X% more often | 1 - 5 | Uncommon |
| Diamond in the Rough | Chance to find rare materials | 20 - 50 | Rare |
| Mountaineer       | Allows foraging in the mt | 1 - 1 | Rare |
| Fisher            | Allows fishing      | 1 - 1   | Rare |

#### Crafting Skills
Crafting skills may increase the chances of getting a rare result or multiply the output from a craft.

### Cryostorage
pets can be kept in cryo & combined (consumed) in that state to create new pets.

## The Base

## Gathering Resources
Gathering resources once an hour is how players can build their base up, participate in the economy, and find rare materials/events.

In order to not be too punishing, a player should be able to build up their gathering for five days before they reach a cap and begin losing resources. This is to strike a balance between driving engagement and being too 'needy'.

| Resource  | Class         | Rarity   | Tier   |
| --------- |:-------------:| --------:| ------:|
| Bronze    | Metal         | Common   |      1 |
| Grain     | Food          | Common   |      1 |
| Water     | Liquid        | Common   |      1 |
| ???       | Science       | Common   |      1 |
| Iron      | Metal         | Common   |      2 |
| Kale      | Food          | Common   |      2 |
|           |               |          |        |
|           |               |          |        |
|           |               |          |        |
|           |               |          |        |
|           |               |          |        |

### Unique Gathering Sources
In addition to the basic harvesting available to all players, certain pet skills might enable harvesting from other sources. For example, a Mountaineer pet would enable the player to send the pet off to find berries or everfrost chips.

These sources will only be available if the pet is active. When multiple pets with these skills are active, the effect should stack -- multiple harvest rolls should be made.

## Crafting

## Economy
Players can sell items of uncommon and above rarity to each other.

### Common Restriction
The restriction on trading in common material is to preserve the time gating crucial to an incremental game. This inhibits people from signing up alt accounts in order to channel the common resources of a dozen alts to one main.

There will be one exception to this rule: a common event will allow players to unlock a crafting recipe that packages up a large amount of common materials once per `period`.

These packaged common materials can be sold and broken down by other players. This allows a rich player to help a friend out. New players may opt to sell their basic resources to fund purchases of necessary rare items, mitigating bad streaks of RNG.

### Shops
- player shops

## Collections
gw2 style, get it once & you get credit

- unlock pets
- unlock recipes

## Events
Events are randomly given quests. Once obtained, the player has `time` to begin the quest. Once begun, a pet or facility will be committed to the event until it is completed.

- some examples pls.
- commit a resource for X hours (bringing it offline for normal resource harvesting) & it gets back x2 what it otherwise would have gotten for that period
	- alt, it gives half of what it would have given, but rare item chance is dramatically increased
